            SONIX provides a communications solution for esports teams and other
            video game-related uses. The SONIX application stands out from its
            competitors for its much lower latency, which makes communication
            between players easier and faster, as the company claimed in a press
            release. The beta version of the SONIX application is currently
            under development, and the partnership with Karmine Corp will allow
            the team's expertise to be used to further guide the development of
            the final product. Players from Karmine Corp will contribute and
            help improve SONIX's offerings for esports players.
